- `artistGenres`

### Relationships

- A **user** owns many **artists**
- An **artist** has many **tourDates**
- An **artist** can have many **genres**
- A **genre** can belong to many **artists**
- `artistGenres` acts as the join table between artists and genres

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start JSON Server

Make sure your database is running on port `8088`:

```bash
json-server -p 8088 -w database.json
```

### 3. Start the React app

If this project is using Create React App:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend should run on:

```txt
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Image Setup

Artist images are stored in:

```txt
public/images/artists/
```

Example:

```txt
public/images/artists/NovaReyes.jpg
```

Then reference them in `database.json` like this:

```json
"photoUrl": "/images/artists/NovaReyes.jpg"
```

---

## Example Artist Record

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Nova Reyes",
  "bio": "Indie-R&B singer-songwriter from Nashville.",
  "photoUrl": "/images/artists/NovaReyes.jpg",
  "originCity": "Nashville, TN",
  "activeSince": 2019,
  "userId": "Q8zjwEq1Ul8"
}
```

---

## Example Genre Relationship

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "artistId": "1",
  "genreId": "1"
}
```

---

## Routes

Current routes include:

- `/` — Home
- `/login` — Login
- `/register` — Register
- `/roster` — My Roster
- `/artists` — Browse All
- `/artists/:artistId` — Artist Profile
- `/artists/new` — Add Artist
- `/artists/:artistId/edit` — Edit Artist
- `/artists/:artistId/tourdates/new` — Add Tour Date

---

## Styling Notes

The UI uses Tailwind utility classes for:
- Layout and spacing
- Borders and rounded cards
- Shadows and hover effects
- Glass-style card backgrounds
- Responsive grid layouts

---

## Roadmap

Planned next steps include:

- Build the **Add Artist** page
- Build the **Browse All** page fully
- Build the **Artist Profile** page
- Add edit/delete functionality for artists
- Add tour date management
- Add better validation and duplicate email checks
- Improve image uploads
- Improve manager-specific features
